# Rhost-Bot

A Discord bot designed to connect to a [RhostMUSH](http://rhostmush.com). This repo is very much under construction still. Right now the bot is under heavy development. **however!** If you'd like to install and run the bot as is:

```
1. git clone https://github.com/digibear.io/rhost-bot/.git
2. cd rhost-bot
3. npm install
4. Configure!  mv config.js.sample config.js
5. node .
```

Have fun! But be aware, it might be broken at the moment. Remember, this repo is under construction. :3
